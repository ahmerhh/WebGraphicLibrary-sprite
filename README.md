# WebGraphicLibrary-sprite

The "Sprite" class is a simple template for creating sprites in your JavaScript projects. Sprites are graphical elements that can be used to represent characters, objects, or any other visual elements in a game or interactive application.

# Installation

Since the "Sprite" class is just a code template and doesn't require any external dependencies, you can simply copy and paste the code into your JavaScript project.

1. Create a new JavaScript file in your project (e.g., sprite.js).
2. Copy the code from this README.md file and paste it into your sprite.js file.
3. Save the sprite.js file.

# Usage

To use the "Sprite" class in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import or include the sprite.js file into your HTML or JavaScript file where you want to use the sprite.
2. Create a new instance of the Sprite class by calling its constructor with the required parameters.

Example:

```javascript
// Import or include the sprite.js file

// Create a new instance of the Sprite class
const mySprite = new Sprite("path/to/sprite-image.png", 50, 50);

Customize the sprite by adding methods and properties specific to your game or application. You can modify the class definition in sprite.js to add functionality like movement, animation, or collision detection.
